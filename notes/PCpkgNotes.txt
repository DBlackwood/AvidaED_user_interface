I made a Windows installer for Avida-ED.
Steps taken:

Cloned av_ui project from GitHub.

Created "avServer.py" file. This is a program that uses the CherryPy web
microframework to establish a standalone web server on the host machine
using port 8080. The CherryPy instance is launched in a thread. A
5-second delay allows for load time of the CherryPy instance. A call to
webbrowser.open() will launch the Avida-ED local URL
(http://localhost:8080/AvidaED.html) in the user's default browser. The
application is portable; avServer.py uses os.getcwd() to obtain the
current working directory and will statically serve files from it.

Used cx_freeze to create an executable version of avserver.py.

python path\to\cxfreeze avServer.py --target-dir dist

Created a directory to combine the executable and Avida-ED files,
"av_ui_file". This puts the executable and its supporting files in the
root of the av_ui files.

Used Inno Setup to create a Windows installer. This results in an
executable setup file less than 29 MB in size.

Uploaded the Windows installer to the bwng.us site.

Altered the index.html file in the Avida-ED directory to also link the
Windows installer file, and display the MD5 hash of the file.


Changes to the Avida-ED program will require running through these steps
again. While this is not a huge effort, it is something additional to do.

I would recommend incorporating the avServer.py file in the GitHub
project. While the Windows installer is, of course, useful only to
Windows users, the avServer.py file should work cross-platform.
cx_freeze could be employed to create Mac OS X and Linux versions of a
standalone executable to serve Avida-ED locally on each of those systems.

========================
First time on new machine (PC or parallels)

Install AnacondaPython  https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Open Anaconda prompt  (start menu - Anaconda - cmd prompt
 - >conda update conda
 -    proceed ([y]/n)?
 - >easy_install cx_freeze
 
Get Inno Setup (use webbrowser)
   http://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
    - get most recent stable release for windows)
    - get QuickStart Pack with unicode (Innosetup-qsp-5.5.9-unicode.exe)
    - double click on file in windows explorer to run install executable
    
========================
Making a new version 

Make a copy of av_ui using get clone (or just copy)
 - work in the copy as it will make alot of intermediate files that I
   don't want in the main repository.
